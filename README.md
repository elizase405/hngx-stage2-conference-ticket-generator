# Task - Conference Ticket Generator
You will build and host a Conference Ticket Generator using React or any React Framework (e.g., Next.js, etc.). The ticket generator will allow users to fill out a form with their details, perform validations on the inputs, and generate a ticket upon successful submission.

## Core Features
1. Form Elements:
	- Full Name: Text input for the user's full name.
	- Email Address: Email input field.
	- Avatar Upload: Users should upload their avatar image and store it using Cloudinary or any image hosting service. The form should only accept and submit the image URL.
	- Submit Button: Button to submit the form.
2. Form Validation:
	- Ensure all required fields are filled in before submission.
	- The email should have a valid format.
	- The avatar upload should accept Cloudinary URLs or any image link.
		- Provide clear error messages near the respective field if validation fails.
3. State Persistence
	- The form should retain user inputs using IndexedDB or local storage so that the data is not lost on page refresh.
4. Accessibility
	- Ensure all form fields, hints, and error messages are screen-reader accessible.
	- All elements must be focusable, with clear hover and focus states.
		- Users must be able to navigate the form and submit it using only the keyboard.
5. Ticket Generation
	- On successful submission, generate and display a Conference Ticket containing:
		- Full Name
		- Email Address
		- Avatar (displayed as an image from the provided URL)
	- The ticket should only be generated if the form passes validation.
6. Responsive Design
	- Ensure the form and ticket layout adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes .
		- Optimize for small screens with proper spacing and stacking.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. State Persistence
	- The form fields should persist user input using IndexedDB or local storage, ensuring data remains intact even if the page is refreshed.
3. Ticket Generation:
	- The generated ticket should display the user’s full name, email, and avatar.
	- The ticket should only appear when all form validations pass successfully.
4. Accessibility:
	- All form elements and error messages must be fully accessible and announced by screen readers.
	- The application must support complete keyboard navigation.
5. Responsive Design:
	- The form and generated ticket must be fully responsive and visually optimized for all device sizes.
	- Ensure the ticket is clearly visible immediately after submission on both mobile and desktop screens.
6. Code Quality:
	- Write modular, well-structured, and readable code.
	- Utilize appropriate React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for state management and validation.
	- Implement proper form element types and validation techniques.
